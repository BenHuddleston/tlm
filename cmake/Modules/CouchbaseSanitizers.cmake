# Helper function to workaround a problem with ASan/TSan, dlopen and
# RPATH:
#
# Background:
#
# Couchbase server (e.g. engine_testapp) makes use of dlopen()
# to load the engine and the testsuite. The runtime linker
# determines the search path to use by looking at the values
# of RPATH and RUNPATH in the executable (e.g. engine_testapp)
#
# - RPATH is the "older" property, it is used by the
#   executable and _any other libraries the executable loads_
#   to locate dlopen()ed files.
#
# - RUNPATH is the "newer" (and more secure) property - is is
#   only used when the executable itself loads a library -
#   i.e. it isn't inherited by opened libraries like RPATH.
#
# (Summary, see `man dlopen` for full details of search
#  order. There's also a good blog post on the full details at:
#  https://blog.qt.io/blog/2011/10/28/rpath-and-runpath/)
#
# CMake will set RPATH / RUNPATH (via linker arg -Wl) to the
# set of directories where all dependancies reside - and this
# is necessary for engine_testapp to load the engine and
# testsuite.
#
# Problem:
#
# When running under Asan/TSan, *San intercepts dlopen()
# and related functions, which results in the dlopen()
# appearing to come from libtsan.so. Given the above, this
# means that if RUNPATH is used, then the dlopen() for engine
# and testsuite fails, as libtsan doesn't have the path to
# ep.so for example embedded in it, and with RUNPATH the paths
# arn't inherited from the main executable.
#
# Newer versions of ld (at least Ubuntu 17.10) now use RUNPATH
# by default (as it is more secure), which means that we hit
# the above problem. To avoid this, use RPATH instead when
# running on a system which recognises the flag.
#
# (To check what dynamic linker variable is used in a binary, run:
#     readelf --dynamic <binary>
# and look for the presence of RPATH / RUNPATH.
