# Unfortunately many Windows conda packages are packaged badly
# ( https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/12156 )
# so we have to bypass this useful safety check.
ignore_duplicate_files: true

channels:
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/

specs:
# These are the packages we explicitly depend on.
# If you change these (packages OR versions), be sure
# to experimentally update the transitive dependencies below!
  - python 3.9.2*

  - msgpack-python 1.0.2
  - natsort 7.1.1
  - python-snappy 0.6.0
  - requests 2.25.1
# These are transitive dependencies of the above. We keep
# them pinned to avoid surprises when newer versions are
# installed. Where possible we pin them to the same version
# in cbdeps.
# Note: One way to create/update this list is to install a local miniconda3
# environment and activate it, then run
#    conda install python=3.9.2\* natsort=5.5.0 .....
#    conda update --update-all
#    conda install python=3.7.3\* natsort=5.5.0 .....
#    conda list
# This may need to be repeated on multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, and
# Mac). Also note that will list "conda" itself and packages that it
# depends on, which we don't want in the final cbpy installer; so take
# care when adding entirely new packages to the list below. Try leaving
# them out at first and see if cbpy builds OK.
